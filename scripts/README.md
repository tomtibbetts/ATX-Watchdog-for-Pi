# Install Scripts for ATX-Watchdog-for-Pi
These scripts were developed under Raspi OS and will work in both the 32 and 64 bit versions.  Instructions given in the product manuals are for the desktop version.  Installation for the 'lite' versions are similar however you need to make sure you have the necessary python libraries installed as well as vcgencmd.  If you look in the Ubuntu scripts section, you'll find instructions for installing the required libraries.

The most important script to install is ATX-Watchdog_install.sh.  It creates the folders needed by the other script and so must be installed first.
