## Ubuntu Install Scripts

The install scripts here are very similar to the install scripts for Raspbian.  The only difference
is that the services in these scripts call python3 instead of python.

Before running these scripts you will need to install additional items:
1. sudo apt install i2c-tools
1. sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio
1. sudo apt install python3-smbus
